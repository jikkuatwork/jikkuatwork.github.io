So, dates in the file name wasn't required? Front matter dates are easier to
reason.

## Value of Splits

Splitted content is more easier to read. Stuff that looks like a clump of
characters is hard to scan. Whenever possible split various sections into
paragraphs with title. Ocassionally use table.

Feature        | Impact
-------------- | ------
Section Splits | 85%
Tables         | 95%
Content        | 65%
Images         | 90%

## Images

Images can be good even when they are not directly related. For instance, we are
talking about blog slugs. Nothing to do with the creature. But an image of the
creature grabs attention.

![slug]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/slug.jpg)

Thats an image lifted from Twitter. I am not planning to give attribution, not
because I want to hide the source, but because I am lazy.

## Laziness

I wanted to conclude with another short passage. Again nothing relevant but
visually beautiful.
